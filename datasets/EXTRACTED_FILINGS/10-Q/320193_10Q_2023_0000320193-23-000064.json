Financial Statements\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except number of shares which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 1\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (Unaudited)\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 2\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except number of shares which are reflected in thousands and par value)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 3\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 4\nApple Inc.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (Unaudited)\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 5\nApple Inc.\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\nNote 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nApproximately 48 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended April 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTotal net sales include $3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, $3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 25, 2021, $5.5 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $4.8 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nNote 3 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n(2)Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n(3)As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.1 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of April 1, 2023 (in millions):\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\nNote 4 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nInventories\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\nNote 6 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $2.0 billion and $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the six months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nTerm Debt\nAs of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.6 billion and $110.1 billion, respectively (collectively the “Notes”). As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $98.4 billion and $98.8 billion, respectively.\nNote 7 - Shareholders’ Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the six months ended April 1, 2023, the Company repurchased 262 million shares of its common stock under an authorized share repurchase program for $38.1 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 11\nNote 8 - Benefit Plans\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the six months ended April 1, 2023 is as follows:\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $1.1 billion and $8.0 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023, respectively, and was $1.0 billion and $9.5 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nAs of April 1, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $23.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\nNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed content and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of April 1, 2023, are as follows (in millions):\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 12\nNote 10 - Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 is as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 13\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:\n•MacBook Pro® 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max chip;\n•Mac mini®, powered by the Apple M2 and M2 Pro chip; and\n•Second-generation HomePod®.\nThe Company repurchased $19.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 14\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\nEurope\nThe weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023.

During the first six months of 2023, the Europe net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone.\nGreater China\nThe weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Greater China net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023. During the second quarter and first six months of 2023, the Greater China net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.\nJapan\nThe weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Japan net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023.

During the first six months of 2023, the Japan net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Services, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nThe weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023. During the second quarter and first six months of 2023, the Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increase consisted primarily of higher net sales of iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (dollars in millions):\niPhone\niPhone net sales were relatively flat during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022.

Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first six months of 2023 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Products mix.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 17\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the U.S. federal R&D credit and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was lower compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\nThe Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing purchase obligations.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 18\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products.

As of April 1, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.5 billion, with $40.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nCapital Return Program\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program, under which the remaining availability was $22.6 billion as of April 1, 2023. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2023. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form 10-K.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of April 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 19",

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):\nApproximately 48 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended April 1, 2023 because their effect would have been antidilutive.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 6\nNote 2 - Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nTotal net sales include $3.5 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, $3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 25, 2021, $5.5 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $4.8 billion of revenue recognized in the six months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\nAs of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater than three years.\nNote 3 - Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 7\n(1)Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n(2)Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n(3)As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.1 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of April 1, 2023 (in millions):\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency-denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt-related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 8\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 9\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%.\nNote 4 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement Details\nThe following tables show the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statement details as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (in millions):\nInventories\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe following table shows the detail of other income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 10\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23, 2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\nNote 6 - Debt\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had $2.0 billion and $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, respectively. The following table provides a summary of cash flows associated with the issuance and maturities of Commercial Paper for the six months ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nTerm Debt\nAs of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.6 billion and $110.1 billion, respectively (collectively the “Notes”). As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the fair value of the Company’s Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $98.4 billion and $98.8 billion, respectively.\nNote 7 - Shareholders’ Equity\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the six months ended April 1, 2023, the Company repurchased 262 million shares of its common stock under an authorized share repurchase program for $38.1 billion, excluding excise tax due under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 11\nNote 8 - Benefit Plans\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the six months ended April 1, 2023 is as follows:\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $1.1 billion and $8.0 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023, respectively, and was $1.0 billion and $9.5 billion for the three- and six-month periods ended March 26, 2022, respectively.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nAs of April 1, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs and stock options was $23.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.\nNote 9 - Commitments and Contingencies\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed content and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of April 1, 2023, are as follows (in millions):\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 12\nNote 10 - Segment Information and Geographic Data\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (in millions):\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 is as follows (in millions):\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 13",
    "part_1_item_2": "Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nFiscal Period\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.\nQuarterly Highlights\nWeakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:\n•MacBook Pro® 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max chip;\n•Mac mini®, powered by the Apple M2 and M2 Pro chip; and\n•Second-generation HomePod®.\nThe Company repurchased $19.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 14\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nSegment Operating Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nAmericas\nAmericas net sales decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\nEurope\nThe weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a net unfavorable year-over-year impact on Europe net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023.

During the first six months of 2023, the Japan net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Services, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac.\nRest of Asia Pacific\nThe weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales during the second quarter and first six months of 2023. During the second quarter and first six months of 2023, the Rest of Asia Pacific net sales increase consisted primarily of higher net sales of iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 15\nProducts and Services Performance\nThe following table shows net sales by category for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 (dollars in millions):\niPhone\niPhone net sales were relatively flat during the second quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2022.

Year-over-year Products gross margin percentage decreased during the first six months of 2023 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Products mix.\nServices Gross Margin\nServices gross margin increased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\nApple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 17\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nResearch and Development\nThe growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.
