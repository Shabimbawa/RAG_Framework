The record-setting deal comes as Big Tech companies turn to nuclear energy to power artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. Jefferies managing director of US power, utilities, and clean energy research Paul Zimbardo joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss his outlook for the nuclear energy space in 2025. \"I think 2025 is going to be a big year for nuclear, both [for] existing nuclear as well as new nuclear,\" Zimbardo says, explaining, \"And it comes back to a topic that we've been following closely. It's just the power demand from data centers, and AI is accelerating.\" The analyst says related stocks still have room to run, with Vistra (VST) and Talen Energy (TLN) as his top picks. While there may be some concerns among investors that President-elect Donald Trump's policies could be negative for nuclear energy, Zimbardo notes the nuclear shift comes from the necessity for more power for AI data centers. \"There's no real options besides the existing nuclear plant. If you want to add your data centers in the next five to seven years.\" Zimbardo expects hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) to continue to acquire nuclear power as well as \"all of the players in large size as well.\" Catch Yahoo Finance's full interview with Goldman Sachs' Carly Davenport on the role regulated utilities will have in building out the energy infrastructure for AI data centers.

To provide corporate insight on this growing trend, Radiant Energy Group managing director Mark Nelson joined Brad Smith and Josh Lipton on Morning Brief. Nelson reflects on the evolution of nuclear energy's prominence, noting that, while 2023 saw increased interest from tech companies, 2024 was \"like the whole world discovered nuclear.\" He explains that the intersection of artificial intelligence and energy requirements led to a realization that \"the tech players didn't have a realistic energy-growth strategy,\" creating an opening for nuclear energy. However, he cautions that despite numerous \"commitments\" from major companies this year, 2025 \"will be the year of 'show me.'\" \"I think what's become clear is that the top executives of these companies were sort of blindsided by the energy problem, and they're scrambling to learn as much about energy as quickly possible,\" Nelson tells Yahoo Finance. While noting that \"nuclear is a special form of energy,\" he remains optimistic about infrastructure development in 2025, stating that \"the noise is all in the right direction.\" Nelson also comments on President-elect Donald Trump's Department of Energy leadership nomination of Chris Wright, saying, \"I've heard nothing but good things.\" He adds, \"When I see Chris Wright coming in, I see somebody who loves what he's heard from the nuclear story, and his job at the Department of Energy will be to see how he can continue the momentum.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.
