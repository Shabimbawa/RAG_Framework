KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the potential widespread impact of the Trump administration's proposed tariff strategy. Vinh notes that these tariffs would have \"a significant impact\" on chip stocks, particularly regarding end-market demand. He explains that tariffs on Mexico would affect the automotive industry, as well, while China-focused tariffs would impact PCs, smartphones, and other consumer electronics. \"As those prices increase, we think there's probably going to be that negative impact to end demand, and ultimately, that's gonna flow upstream to all the chip companies,\" he explains. While some companies might attempt to shift production to the US, Vinh points out that the semiconductor industry lacks the necessary \"flexibility\" for such transitions. Despite the challenging outlook, Vinh highlights Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM), and On Semiconductor (ON) as stocks positioned to potentially outperform in this scenario.
