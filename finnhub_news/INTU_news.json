So you could continue to expect the momentum continuing. Credit Karma, similarly, expect the momentum to continue adjusted.\" Aujla also comments on the proposed IRS tax filing app being considered by President-elect Donald Trump's proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as reported by the Washington Post.
