        "summary": "Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has had a month, as one would say. He provided more details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin at its big annual GTC conference, chips that could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity. At the same time, he moved to alter the narrative that DeepSeek's advances in AI equaled bad news for demand for Nvidia's chips. And to top it all off, he held a meeting with top quantum computing CEOs to make peace after sending the sector reeling earlier this year. Despite the flurry of headlines, Nvidia\u2019s stock is still going in reverse. In fact, the stock has been lagging for the entire year. What gives? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with BofA semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya about what\u2019s weighing on Nvidia\u2019s super hot stock, why Arya attended GTC, and shares his firsthand account on what he learned on the ground. Arya is also fresh off upgrading shares of ailing chipmaker Intel (INTC) amid the appointment of a new CEO in Lip-Bu Tan. Sozzi and Arya discuss that big call and the state of the semiconductor industry. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.
