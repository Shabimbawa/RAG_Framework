They have been spacing out the way that they buy in order to make sure that they have their gifts for the holiday season,\" Ramirez explains. \"And because we've had the pressure from inflation throughout the year and... from late last year, it has started to really take on savings of consumers. So it's still very tough.\" She elaborates that retailer promotions have also been \"very strategic\" in comparison to inventory levels.
