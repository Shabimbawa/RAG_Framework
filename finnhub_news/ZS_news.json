To speak more about the earnings print, Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry joins Market Domination Overtime. \"The market remains tight, there is scrutiny on large deals. But if you do two things, CIOs will want to work with you: Number one, good cyber security with zero trust architecture, because the firewall-based, VPN-based security is no longer working,\" Chaudhry underlines, while noting the company's record free cash flow margin. \"But along with cyber, if you can tell the CIO that I can take some cost out and save money, you can get the deals done and you can deliver good numbers. That's how Zscaler has done business.\" Chaudhry also comments on Canessa's retirement, who will stay on as CFO until a successor for the role is selected.
