C3.ai founder and CEO Tom Siebel joins Morning Brief Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss the print and what's next for the artificial intelligence (AI) company. The CEO addresses the stock move, saying, \"Markets kind of thrash around a little bit, and I think yesterday the stock was up huge... Bottom line, we had a great quarter, I think, [with] 29% year-over-year growth. We finished the quarter with almost three-quarters of $1 billion cash [and] announced a very, very important strategic alignment with Microsoft (MSFT).\" He adds, \"The stock will take care of itself. It's a positive story.\" Siebel explains C3.ai's pivotal position in the enterprise AI landscape: \"We have over 100 products in the space now. We've gone from [an] order of 100 salespeople in September to [an] order of tens of thousands of salespeople in November, all around the world, every vertical, every geography.\" He notes, \"This is huge. This is a growth accelerator, and, in the medium run, it will result in massive, I think, revenue growth and massive cash flow. So there's nothing that's not good about this.\" Watch the video above for more on C3.ai's partnerships with Microsoft and Baker Hughes (BKR), the CEO's expectations for the incoming Trump administration, and more.

Oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) \u2014 components of the so-called Trump Trade \u2014 saw gains the day after this week's election Evercore ISI senior managing director James West speaks more about whether fears of Trump's impact on the industry are overblown. \"The fact remains that the IRA bill, which is the largest investment in climate and clean tech that the world has ever seen, is largely going to remain intact because 80% of the job creation and the capital spending is going to red states, or red districts, if not higher now that more states have flipped red,\" West tells Yahoo Finance. Clean energy producers and even nuclear energy developers have been posed as the solution to AI data center's energy demands. \"The AI prize is so big that they want to use whatever energy source they have now, and whatever energy source they can use in the future to capture that prize. And so we think actually natural gas is going to be a big winner over the next couple of decades,\" West explains to Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. \"And from a volume standpoint, because they're going to use a lot of natural gas. They already have natural gas facilities, have the infrastructure in place as we're building out more clean energy as we get to a nuclear renaissance.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination\u00a0here.
