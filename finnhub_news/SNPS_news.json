The company's focus remains on its artificial intelligence (AI)-driven reinvention of computing, particularly in design activities. Synopsys CEO and President Sassine Ghazi joins Market Domination hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to discuss how the AI revolution is impacting industries. \"Like any disruptive technology \u2014 and AI is absolutely one of the mega trends that will drive a completely different change in many end market applications workflows \u2014 it started with big investments in data centers and infrastructure build-out,\" Ghazi says. While AI and high-performance computing remain robust, smart technology in other sectors like automotive and industrial face challenges, with recovery expected by late 2025. Ghazi also addresses ongoing headwinds in China. \"What we communicated actually yesterday, as we're reaffirming the guidance for the year, is these headwinds are going to continue, and the deceleration will continue to below corporate average due to two factors,\" he explains. These factors Ghazi notes are the cumulative effect of restrictions slowing down chip activities, particularly for high-end chips in China, and the ongoing macroeconomic challenges within China itself.

        "summary": "Despite a fourth quarter beat on both adjusted earnings and revenue, shares of Synopsys (SNPS) fell sharply Thursday after the chip design company provided a weaker-than-expected forecast for 2025. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Synopsys President and CEO Sassine Ghazi argues that while the company's 2025 guidance may be below Street expectations, it is still on a growth trajectory. \"If you look at Synopsys' performance over the last five years, it has definitely been up and to the right with a 15% CAGR growth during that period,\" he said. \"We doubled the size of the company during that period due to an AI inflection point and significant investments by our customers to build silicon for the data centers to satisfy that opportunity.\" Ghazi acknowledged that parts of Synopsys' business are lagging, but in his estimation, the company is doing business in two unique markets. \"There is the AI infrastructure, and every company that is building semiconductors or any solutions for the AI infrastructure is booming, and we're doing fantastic with that. Then there is the other cohort, which is the rest of the semiconductor industry that's selling to mobile, to PC, industrial, automotive, they're at a different point in time when it comes to their recovery.\" The CEO also pointed to Synopsys' business in China, which is struggling as a result of the United States' placing controls on what chip technology can be sold in the country. \"Pretty much every quarter we get new customers added to the entity list,\" Ghazi said. \"That's revenue that disappears off our backlog as well as technology restrictions. Even customers that they're not on the entity list, however, they cannot design competitive chips due to restrictions, and these factors do have an impact on our business in China.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.
