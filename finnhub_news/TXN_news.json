However, shifting production to the US is not an immediate solution, as Lopez states, \"it is physically impossible\" to build new foundries quickly. This means the industry faces a tricky balance of continuing innovation while navigating the complexities of global operations. Businesses must find ways to manage this transition over time while also negotiating with international partners. \"So, we've had the opening volley to say negotiations start now. We need to get a plan between now and April to make that happen,'\" Lopez concludes. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief\u00a0here.

        "summary": "As earnings season continues for most of the Big Tech landscape, Wall Street investors have become increasingly focused on tech giant's and hyperscaler's capital expenditure (CapEx) spending on AI. To talk more about how AI CapEx guidance is weighing on Big Tech and semiconductor manufacturers like Nvidia (NVDA), Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska sits down with Seana Smith on Catalysts. Delevska finds the release of DeepSeek's large-language model to have been a positive for Nvidia: \"The market completely misinterpreted this to begin with. I think it may be negative for some of the other companies in the value chain, like open source models, but for companies that are making hardware, more innovation is always, by definition, better.\" Delevska goes on to comment on how cheaper AI chip models could benefit Cloudflare (NET), Arista's (ANET) position in AI networking, and reacts to reports of OpenAI's plans to develop their first custom chip design. The last of the Magnificent Seven to report its latest quarterly performance, Nvidia is scheduled to release earnings results on Wednesday, February 26.

KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the potential widespread impact of the Trump administration's proposed tariff strategy. Vinh notes that these tariffs would have \"a significant impact\" on chip stocks, particularly regarding end-market demand. He explains that tariffs on Mexico would affect the automotive industry, as well, while China-focused tariffs would impact PCs, smartphones, and other consumer electronics. \"As those prices increase, we think there's probably going to be that negative impact to end demand, and ultimately, that's gonna flow upstream to all the chip companies,\" he explains. While some companies might attempt to shift production to the US, Vinh points out that the semiconductor industry lacks the necessary \"flexibility\" for such transitions. Despite the challenging outlook, Vinh highlights Nvidia (NVDA), Arm Holdings (ARM), and On Semiconductor (ON) as stocks positioned to potentially outperform in this scenario.

The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole. T. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup. \"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\" While the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" He also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.

        "summary": "United States-China semiconductor tensions are escalating as the US considers banning Chinese-made routers present in millions of American homes. Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. \"What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'\" Goujon explains. She describes a new \"single chip de minimis\" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. \"So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'\" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: \"The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtime\u00a0here.
