Further, the amount of any tax receivables (which have been confirmed by the Finnish Tax Administration as refundable or creditable to Wolt) of value-added taxes arising with respect to Wolt&#8217;s transaction costs will be taken into account when computing the amount of the Consideration Adjustments and hence also the amount of the Per Share Closing Stock Consideration. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, each Seller will agree that the consideration payable to each Wolt shareholder in connection with the Purchase (including with respect to the method of calculating the amount of consideration that each Wolt shareholder is entitled to receive with respect to the preference amounts (or otherwise) pursuant to the Wolt Stockholders&#8217; Agreements or pursuant to the Wolt Articles of Association, collectively, the &#8220;<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Payment Rights</span></span>&#8221;) is and shall constitute the sole and exclusive consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in connection with the Purchase, that the shares of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock payable to such holder pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement shall satisfy in full the Payment Rights, and that no Seller shall have any further claim, and each Seller expressly waives any claim, with respect to or in any way related to any Payment Rights or any rights to receive any Wolt shares following the Closing. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Total Share Consideration will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock between the date that the Share Purchase Agreement was signed and completion of the Transaction. Changes in the market price of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock prior to the completion of the Transaction will affect the value that Wolt securityholders will receive in the Transaction.

Any changes in the amount of the Consideration Adjustments or Wolt&#8217;s other purchase price adjustment estimates, as compared to the estimated amounts used for purposes of the above estimate, would result in the dilution of the ownership of existing holders of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock being proportionately decreased or increased, as applicable.

The Support Agreements were entered into by holders of 5% or more of Wolt shares, executive officers, directors or founders of Wolt.

Under the terms of the Wolt Stockholders&#8217; Agreements, Wolt shareholders have tag along rights that they can exercise via a notice to join the Transaction and sell their Wolt shares to DoorDash. Pursuant to the Wolt Stockholders&#8217; Agreements, the tag along notice is also required to be sent to the holders of Wolt options in order to provide them with an opportunity to exercise their Vested Wolt Options prior to the Closing. Exercise of the tag along right is not required for a Wolt shareholder to participate in the Purchase and such exercise of the tag along right would not change the terms and conditions under which Wolt shareholders&#8217; shares will be transferred to DoorDash. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If all Wolt shareholders do not voluntarily accede to the Transaction by way of signing a Joinder Agreement within forty (40)&#160;days following Registration Statement Effective Date, Wolt and each Supporting Stockholder shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Share Purchase Agreement and within two (2)&#160;business days thereafter, commence the Drag-Along Exercise, cause the Drag-Along Exercise to remain effective through the completion of the Transaction and cause a Joinder Agreement to be executed on behalf of each Wolt shareholder that has not duly executed and delivered a binding Joinder Agreement as such person&#8217;s or entity&#8217;s agent and attorney pursuant the Wolt Stockholders&#8217; Agreement.

These estimates are based on several estimates and assumptions, including (among others) that the Closing would occur during the first half of calendar year 2022, Wolt&#8217;s current estimate of the Consideration Adjustments (including a preliminary forecast of Wolt&#8217;s closing balance sheet), the estimated number of Wolt securities anticipated to be outstanding as of the Closing, that no Liquidation Preference <span style="white-space:nowrap">Top-Up</span> Shares will be issuable in connection with the Purchase and that none of the DoorDash shares, options or restricted stock units issuable in connection with the Closing will need to be withheld or escrowed as <span style="white-space:nowrap">True-Up</span> Escrow Shares, <span style="white-space:nowrap">True-Up</span> Escrow Substitute Options or <span style="white-space:nowrap">True-Up</span> Escrow Substitute RSUs. Subject to the foregoing, Wolt currently estimates that the Per Share Closing Stock Consideration (after reduction for the Indemnity Escrow Shares, Indemnity Escrow Substitute Options and Indemnity Escrow RSUs) would equal approximately 0.059. Based on the amount of such estimated Per Share Closing Stock Consideration, Wolt estimates (i)&#160;that one (1)&#160;share of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock would be issuable in connection with the Closing to a Seller holding approximately 17 to 18 Wolt Shares at the time of Closing, and (ii)&#160;that a </p>

The number of shares of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock issuable with respect to Stock-Eligible Vested Wolt Options and the number of Substitute RSUs that will be granted with respect to Substitution-Eligible Unvested Wolt Options will depend, in part, on the exercise price payable upon the exercise of such Wolt option. Based on the above estimate of the Per Share Closing Stock Consideration and the range of exercise prices applicable to the Stock-Eligible Vested Wolt Options and Substitution-Eligible Unvested Wolt Options that are outstanding on the date hereof, Wolt estimates (a)&#160;that one (1)&#160;share of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock would be issuable in connection with the Closing with respect to Stock-Eligible Vested Wolt Options entitling such holder to subscribe for approximately 17 to 20 Wolt Shares and (b)&#160;that a Substitute RSU to receive one (1)&#160;share of DoorDash Class&#160;A common stock would be issuable with respect to a Substitution-Eligible Unvested Wolt Option entitling such holder to subscribe for approximately 17 to 20 Wolt Shares.
