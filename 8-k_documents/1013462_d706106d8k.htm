These forward-looking statements are based on Ansys&#8217; current expectations, estimates and projections about the expected date of closing of the proposed transaction and the potential benefits thereof, its business and industry, management&#8217;s beliefs and certain assumptions made by Ansys and Synopsys, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;anticipate,&#8221; &#8220;intend,&#8221; &#8220;plan,&#8221; &#8220;believe,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;seek,&#8221; &#8220;see,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;might,&#8221; &#8220;potentially,&#8221; &#8220;estimate,&#8221; &#8220;continue,&#8221; &#8220;expect,&#8221; &#8220;target,&#8221; similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof.

to make or take any filing or other action required to consummate the transaction on a timely matter or at all, are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i)&#160;the completion of the proposed transaction on anticipated terms and timing, including obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals, anticipated tax treatment, unforeseen liabilities, future capital expenditures, revenues, expenses, earnings, synergies, economic performance, indebtedness, financial condition, losses, future prospects, business and management strategies for the management, expansion and growth of Ansys&#8217; and Synopsys&#8217; businesses and other conditions to the completion of the transaction; (ii)&#160;failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction, including as a result of delay in completing the transaction or integrating the businesses of Ansys and Synopsys; (iii)&#160;Ansys&#8217; ability to implement its business strategy; (iv)&#160;pricing trends, including Ansys&#8217; and Synopsys&#8217; ability to achieve economies of scale; (v)&#160;potential litigation relating to the proposed transaction that could be instituted against Ansys, Synopsys or their respective directors; (vi)&#160;the risk that disruptions from the proposed transaction will harm Ansys&#8217; or Synopsys&#8217; business, including current plans and operations; (vii)&#160;the ability of Ansys or Synopsys to retain and hire key personnel; (viii)&#160;potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; (ix)&#160;uncertainty as to the long-term value of Synopsys&#8217; common stock; (x)&#160;legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting Ansys&#8217; and Synopsys&#8217; businesses; (xi)&#160;general economic and market developments and conditions; (xii)&#160;the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which Ansys and Synopsys operate; (xiii)&#160;potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Transaction that could affect Ansys&#8217; or Synopsys&#8217; financial performance; (xiv)&#160;restrictions during the pendency of the proposed transaction that may impact Ansys&#8217; or Synopsys&#8217; ability to pursue certain business opportunities or strategic transactions; (xv)&#160;unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, as well as Ansys&#8217; and Synopsys&#8217; response to any of the aforementioned factors; and (xvi)&#160;failure to receive the approval of the stockholders of Ansys. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, are more fully discussed in the proxy statement/prospectus to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the proxy statement/prospectus will be, considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Ansys&#8217; or Synopsys&#8217; consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Neither Ansys nor Synopsys assumes any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. </p>
