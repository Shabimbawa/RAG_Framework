In addition, any Spinco employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated by Discovery or Spinco or one of its subsidiaries within two years of the closing will be entitled to receive at least the same severance benefits that such individual would have received immediately prior to the closing. Spinco will also be responsible for providing certain retention payments to select individuals who remain continuously employed with Spinco or its subsidiaries for 90 days following the closing, and to provide enhanced severance benefits to select employees. </p> <p style="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AT&amp;T equity awards that were granted to Spinco employees prior to May 17, 2021 and are vested and outstanding as of closing will remain AT&amp;T equity awards and be adjusted as appropriate in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans to reflect the transaction.
